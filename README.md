# Traffic light simulator
## Description
The application simulates the operation of a single traffic light consisting of three sections (green, yellow and red) in manual and automatic modes. In manual mode any section can be tuned on and off arbitrarily. In automatic mode the traffic light works according to its standard program.
When the application is started, a graphic window opens (Fig. 1) in which the traffic light is programmatically drawn using the simple graphic primitives. The application is written in С using Win32API. It can successfully be compiled with the Mingw-w64 – GCC and run under Windows (7 and higher).
